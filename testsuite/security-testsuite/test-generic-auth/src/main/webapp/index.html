        <h3>Testing The Properties File Security Realm</h3>
        <p>The 2 properties files are located under <I>WASCE_HOME</I>/var/security: <b>demo_groups.properties</b> & <b>demo_users.properties</b></p>
        <p>
        Once this sample has been installed, click on <a href='protect/hello.html'>Protect</a> to validate against the properties file. You will be shown a login screen, use the following usernames and passwords to login:
        <p>username=<b>alan</b>    password=<b>starcraft</b></p>
        <p>username=<b>metro</b>    password=<b>mouse</b></p>
        <p>username=<b>george</b>    password=<b>bone</b></p>
        
        If everything works, you should see "hello world" in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>At this point you have an application that is validating username and passwords against the properties file based on the security configuration you provided earlier. Now, if you go back here and click on <a href='forbidden/'>Forbidden</a> you should receive a 403 - Forbidden HTTP error.</p>
